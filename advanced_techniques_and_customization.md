title: Advanced Techniques and Customization
---

This chapter explores advanced techniques and customization options for `text-fabric`.  These techniques require a more in-depth understanding of the `text-fabric` API and potentially other Python libraries.  We'll cover topics such as customizing the `TF` object, working with large datasets efficiently, and integrating with other tools.


## Recipe 1: Customizing the `TF` object

The `TF` object is the core of `text-fabric`.  You can customize it to extend its functionality by adding custom features or functions.  This example shows how to add a custom function to calculate the average sentence length:

```python
from text_fabric import TF

tf = TF('path/to/your/dataset')

def average_sentence_length(tf_obj):
    """Calculates the average sentence length in a text."""
    sentences = tf_obj.get_sentence_objects() # Adapt to your dataset's sentence structure
    total_words = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        total_words += len(sentence.words)  # Adapt to your dataset's word structure
    return total_words / len(sentences) if len(sentences) > 0 else 0


# Add the custom function to the TF object (This part depends on your TF object structure)
# tf.add_function('average_sentence_length', average_sentence_length)


# Now you can use it:
avg_length = average_sentence_length(tf)
print(f"Average sentence length: {avg_length}")
This code defines a custom function average_sentence_length and then (in the commented-out section) adds it to the TF object. The exact method of adding the function will depend on the structure of your TF object. You may need to consult the text-fabric documentation or adapt this part for your specific needs.

Recipe 2: Working with Large Datasets Efficiently
Working with large datasets requires strategies to optimize performance and memory usage. Key considerations include:

Lazy Loading: text-fabric often employs lazy loading, meaning data is loaded only when needed. This minimizes memory consumption.
Data Filtering: Filter your data early to reduce the amount of data you need to process. Use tf.search() strategically to select only the relevant parts of your dataset.
Chunking: Process the data in smaller chunks to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
Vectorization: If appropriate, use NumPy or other libraries for vectorized operations to speed up calculations.
Here's an example of using tf.search() for efficient data filtering:


from text_fabric import TF

tf = TF('path/to/your/dataset')

#Instead of processing all nodes, select only a subset
relevant_nodes = tf.search(tf.L.pos == 'VERB')

for node in relevant_nodes:
    #Process only the relevant nodes
    print(tf.features.words.word.v(node))
Recipe 3: Integrating with Other Tools
text-fabric can be integrated with other Python libraries to extend its capabilities. For example, you might integrate it with:

Visualization libraries (e.g., NetworkX, matplotlib): Create visualizations of textual relationships or networks.
NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK): Perform advanced NLP tasks such as named entity recognition or sentiment analysis.
Statistical packages (e.g., pandas, statsmodels): Perform statistical analysis on the extracted linguistic data.
Example of integrating with matplotlib (requires adapting to your data):


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from text_fabric import TF

tf = TF('path/to/your/dataset')

# ... (Extract data for plotting, e.g., word frequencies) ...
word_frequencies = {  # Example data; replace with your data
    'word1': 10,
    'word2': 5,
    'word3': 15
}

words = list(word_frequencies.keys())
counts = list(word_frequencies.values())

plt.bar(words, counts)
plt.xlabel("Words")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Word Frequencies")
plt.show()
Recipe 4: Extending the API (Advanced)
For advanced users, it's possible to extend the text-fabric API itself by contributing new modules or functions. This requires a deeper understanding of the package's architecture and coding conventions. Consult the text-fabric documentation for guidelines on contributing to the project.

This chapter provides a glimpse into the advanced possibilities of text-fabric. Experiment with these techniques and explore the text-fabric API to unlock the full potential of this powerful tool for your research. Remember that adapting these examples to your specific dataset and research questions is crucial.
